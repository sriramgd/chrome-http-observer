Yet another Chrome extension to observe http traffic for a Chrome tab.

How to get started:
- Go to a web page, open extension and reload to view http traffic.
- Navigate to any page on the same tab after that.
- For each request, drill down into headers, cookies and response.
- View summary information for a web page. Summary button loads a few seconds after page load.

And:
- This extension will not work when Chrome dev tools is open.
- For more details and better performance, you should really be using Chrome developer tools.
